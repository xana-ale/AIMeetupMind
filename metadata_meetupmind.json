        "text": "\"Thanks, Adrian. Hello everyone. Today I\u2019ll talk about one of the hottest problems in AI \u2014 LLM Alignment.\nWhat is alignment? In simple terms, it's the effort to make AI systems behave in a way that aligns with human values and intentions.\n\nWhy is this hard?\nLet me give you an example. Suppose you ask an AI for job recommendations. If the training data is biased against certain genders or ethnic groups, the AI might reproduce that bias. We've seen this happen \u2014 AI recommending lower-paying jobs to women, for instance.\n\nAnother example is in financial services \u2014 models might deny credit to certain populations because of historic bias in the data.\n\nAnd this isn't just a static problem \u2014 it\u2019s a snowball effect. If users start trusting AI-generated outputs, those outputs get recycled into future training data. This amplifies existing biases over time.\n\nSo what can be done? A few methods are in play:\n\n    Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) \u2014 basically teaching the AI what is desirable or not.\n\n    Bias audits and dataset cleaning.\n\n    Differential privacy to prevent amplifying bad patterns.\n\nBut honestly \u2014 this is far from solved. Even OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind \u2014 they're struggling with this every day.\""

You\u2019ve probably heard about LLMs \u2014 but what about AI Agents?\n\nThese are LLMs connected with tools, APIs, memory systems... capable of reasoning step by step, executing tasks, and even collaborating with other agents.\n\nAgent orchestration is one of the hottest topics in 2025.\nImagine an agent who reads your emails, updates your Jira board, sends reports, and even books your dentist appointment.\n\nThe challenge? Tool usage, reasoning failures, hallucinations, and cost.\nHow do you balance running 50 agents without spending your entire salary on API calls?\n\nAlso, agents aren't truly 'intelligent' \u2014 they simulate reasoning based on patterns learned from language. It\u2019s cool but limited.\nFor example, they can plan, but they can\u2019t really understand why they're doing it.\""
